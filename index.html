    <h3 id="para"> The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were launched by the United Nations in 2015, designed to guide global progress toward sustainable development by 2030. These 17 goals address key issues such as poverty, hunger, education, gender equality, and environmental sustainability. Their focus is on balancing economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. Key goals include SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being, SDG 4: Quality Education, and SDG 13: Climate Action, which encourages global efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change through sustainable practices. The SDGs call for collaboration across governments, businesses, and civil society to foster a more sustainable future.</h3>
